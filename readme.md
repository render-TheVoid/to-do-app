# **✅ To-Do App (But Make It Personal)**  
Because your tasks aren’t gonna ignore themselves.

🧠 What’s This?  
A basic to-do app made with HTML, CSS & JavaScript…  
Add stuff. Edit mistakes. Delete regrets. Repeat.

🎯 Features  
- ➕ Add tasks (finally write “make to-do app”)  
- 📝 Edit them (because typos are human)  
- 🗑️ Delete them (denial is a feature, not a bug)

🧪 Tech  
HTML (structure-ish)  
CSS (vibes)  
JavaScript (functional... mostly)

💀 Coming Soon  
- More sarcasm  
- Dark mode that reflects your soul  
- Button that does nothing (for aesthetic)

Use it. Forget the task. Delete it anyway.
